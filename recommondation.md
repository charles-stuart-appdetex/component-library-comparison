## Recommendation

### MUI

1. Backed by pro license and company
2. Has more of the components we need
3. Has more components
4. Uses modern CSS in JS solution for styling and customization
5. MUI-RFF integrates MUI with React Final Form
6. Very good accessibility
7. Pro license includes access to advanced grid and datepicker
8. Option to use base unstyled components
9. Provides design resources for both Figma and Sketch
10. More mature than Chakra-ui, more advanced components
11. At least 17 employees
12. The most popular react component library

### Not Chosen

#### Chakra

Biggest knocks against Chakra:

1. Missing some components
2. Some components on the simple side where we would benefit from more advanced features
3. Seems like a slightly less viable organization behind it
4. No design templates, no plans to support them
5. It seems like they want to rely on the community to submit PRs for new components. I'd rather go with an option where they have full time employees working on them.
6. They seem like they're in the middle of a big refactor, which looks like it has very good aims, but it's still in progress a year on
7. Some demos for their pro components are broken

#### Ant

Reasons to not go with Ant:

1. Poor accessibility
2. Not clear how they make money, how sustainable they would be
3. Least optimal strategy for theming and customization

They do have very advanced components, and a ton of them.
