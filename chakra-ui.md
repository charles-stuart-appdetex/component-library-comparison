### Theming/Styles

> A core concept to be considered when comparing the two frameworks is 'Ease of Modification'. Comparatively, Material UI adds far more classes to individual HTML tags related to exported components and layouts, forcing developers to fight against base styles when customizing their interface. Chakra gives developers far more freedom to manipulate CSS classes of exported components and layouts and often requires less code to do so. For example, Material UI requires separate code to control responsive styling based on viewport changes, while Chakra provides built-in support for responsive styling without the need to create CSS classes or media queries. If custom styling is not a major concern for your project, Material UI is beneficial as you can avoid the creation of custom components that the library provides. If scalable, custom designs are important for your project (which oftentimes they are), Chakra's developer convenience shines brighter than Material UI's especially as a project scales over time.

Can configure theme and styles by component. It's not quite as efficient as I'd like it to be, but it will work.
